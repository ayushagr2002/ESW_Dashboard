The dashboard shows live data of the 4 water quality parameters (Temperature, Turbidity, TDS, pH) by fetching from thingspeak. It also can show past sensor values and data for any period of time. The tabulated data can also be downloaded as a CSV file for further analysis. People can also subscribe to the alerts by providing their email IDs after which they will recieve notifications whenever the water quality drops below the safety threshold.
